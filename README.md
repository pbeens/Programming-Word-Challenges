# Programming Word Challenges
 A place for programming teachers to find resources related to word challenges. 

## Example Challenges

1. What are the longest words in the list?
1. If a-1, b=2, etc., what words add up to 100?
1. What is the longest word that ends with "ar".
1. What is the most common letter? Vowel? Consonant?
1. How many palindromes are in the list?
1. What's the longest word ladder list you can make. (A word ladder is a sequence of words where only one letter changes at a time. e.g., "hit" → "hot" → "dot")
1. What's the longest list you can make where you start with a two letter word, and then by reusing those letters and adding one more you can come up with another word. e.g., "or" → "for" → "fort")

The following challenges have been submitted by Ross Jamieson:

8. **All Vowels** - Find all sets of 5 words that have each of the vowels in the same position. Example sets: MATE, METE, MITE, MOTE MUTE; BAT, BET, BIT, BOT, BUT.
1. **Most Letters** - Find the 26 words with the most of each of the letters of the alphabet. Breaking ties part 1: If two words have the same number of a letter, the "better” answer is the shorter word. BUBBLE is better than BUBBLING. Breaking ties part 2: If two words have the same number of a letter, and the same length, the word that doesn’t start with the letter is “better”. HUBBUB is better than BUBBLE.
1. **Murica** - List all the words that can be spelled using only the [2-letter shortcodes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jasonong/List-of-US-States/master/states.csv) for the 50 American states. (AL, AK, AZ, AR, CA, CO, CT, …)
Example: VANDAL (Virginia, North Dakota, Alabama).
1. **Backwards** - List all words for which the reversed word is also a word, but not a palindrome. Example: STRESSED
